### App Idea: Campus Trade

**Campus Trade** is a student-to-student marketplace app where college students can buy, sell, or trade used items like textbooks, electronics, or dorm essentials. Users must register with a verified school email address. The app will include trust-based features like verified listings, seller reviews, and campus-based filters. The goal is to simplify local student commerce and promote sustainability through item reuse.

## Notes

- Challenge: Setting up the @IBAction and linking the storyboard to the code correctly in Xcode.
- Solution: Used Assistant Editor to create and connect the button to its function.
- Future improvement: Allow users to set their favorite color themes and save preferences.
